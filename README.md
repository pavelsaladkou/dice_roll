# dice_roll

### OBJECTIVE

Write a program that simulates the rolling of two six-sided die. The program should call a function 
called roll that returns the value of the die. This function should use the pseudorandom number generator function, rand().

Your program should roll the two die 36,000 times.

Your program should count up the number of times each possible sum appears and output the results in a table 
format with the appropriate column headings. In addition, calculate the probability of each sum. Compare and 
contrast the experimental results versus the theoretical results. For full credit your program must use functional 
decomposition to solve the problem. I.e. you must use more than one function to solve the problem.
